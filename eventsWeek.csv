11 places to see fall foliage in/around Boston,"Saturday, Sep 28, 2024",7:00a,"Saturday, Nov 30, 2024",7:00p,Boston,Boston/Cambridge,FREE,"Date Idea, Photoworthy, Seasonal",https://newengland.com/seasons/fall/foliage/peak-fall-foliage-map,"2024 fall foliage in Boston is expected to peak in mid to late October. Each year, Greater Boston plays host to some of the most vibrant fall foliage colors in the entire world. Besides stepping foot outside your door, or heading to a local park, here are some prime spots around the city to peep fall foliage.2024 fall foliage map for Boston: Head to newengland.com's peak foliage map to see when leaves are predicted to reach peak around Greater Boston.1) Mount Auburn CemeteryWith over 5,000 trees representing 600+ species, Mount Auburn Cemetery is one of the best places to peep fall foliage in the Boston area. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @matthewraifman)2) Boston Public GardenBuilt in 1837, Boston Public Garden was the first botanical garden in the United States. Naturally, the park turns into a foliage wonderland in October. Be sure to check out the adjacent Boston Common for bonus foliage. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @kylekleinphoto)3) Charles River EsplanadeWith a population of 1,700 trees, the Charles River Esplanade turns all sorts of shades of red, orange, and yellow throughout fall. Open in Google Maps.4) Commonwealth AvenueThe Comm Ave Mall (pictured) really steals the show as far as foliage goes in Back Bay. But the colors don’t stop there. You can peep spectacular foliage all throughout the Back Bay and its bordering neighborhood, the South End, in autumn. Look out for magnificent displays of pumpkins and gourds on residential steps in both neighborhoods. In the South End, check out Rutland Square and Southwest Corridor Park for all those foliage feels. Open in Google Maps.

Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @jackdarylphotography)6) Arnold ArboretumThe Arboretum's collection of almost 5,000 different species put on a fiery display throughout most of the month of October. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @arnold_arboretum)7) Memorial Drive CambridgeMemorial Drive, which runs along the Charles River in Cambridge, becomes quite the fall fairyland every October. Bonus: Every Sunday from the last Sunday of April until the second Sunday of November, Memorial Drive is closed to traffic between Western Avenue and Mount Auburn Street, and open for leaf peeping. Open in Google Maps.8) Acorn Street BostonPerhaps Boston’s most visually iconic street, Acorn Street in Beacon Hill is the epitome of New England fall lined with cobblestones and historic brick homes. In the fall the brilliant autumnal colors make it look even more magical. Do note: the neighbors on Acorn Street can get a little worn out by the tourism so keep a respectful distance when visiting. Open in Google Maps.9) Back Bay FensStroll through the country’s oldest continuously operating Victory Gardens and a series of lawns and greenspace around the Muddy River carefully designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. You’ll still be in the heart of Boston, but it feels like you’ve left the city for a natural oasis. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by Andrea Monari on Flickr)10) Harvard University’s CampusYou may recall the campus in its autumnal glory in 'The Social Network' when the Zuckerberg character gets dumped then runs across campus back to his dorm to begin coding Facebook for the first time. (The scene was actually filmed at Johns Hopkins University, but no worries, Harvard is still a fall foliage wonderland in October.) Come experience it for yourself! The bustling campus filled with fall foliage feels especially cozy in the autumn. Open in Google Maps.11) Cedar Grove CemeteryLocated on the banks of the Neponset River in Dorchester, Cedar Grove Cemetery is a beautiful and carefully maintained map of gardens, ponds, and resting places. It’s also the spot where you can see the retro Mattapan trolley driving through a foliage-flooded track. Find the bridge nearest Adams Street and you'll see the MBTA trolley tracks running through the Cemetery. Open in Google Maps.

How to Make Friends in Boston: Part 3 - Fall Edition,"Friday, Oct 25, 2024",9:00a,"Tuesday, Dec 31, 2024",11:00p,Boston,Surrounding areas,Unknown,"Art, Classes, Date Idea, Drinks, Games, Good for Groups, LGBTQ+, Meetup, Nature, Party, Photoworthy, Seasonal, Sports & Active Life",Not specified,"Your favorite How to Make Friends in Boston series is back with a little twist! Whether you’ve just moved to the city during the fall season or you’re looking for new pals to explore the beauty of Boston as it turns to shades of orange and red, this list has some ideas for how to put yourself out there and grow your community. 🎃By Yelena Nicolle Salvador1) Enjoy cozy activitiesAs the weather turns a bit cooler, you might be feeling the urge to begin to nest inside. No worries, there’s plenty of things to get you to meet folks as you huddle indoors.Check out Pottery With A Purpose, a lovely business that hosts make-your-own pottery mugs, vases, planters, and other containers. Most people come solo to these classes, which are usually small and intimate. It’s a fun way to create, sip on a brew while you channel your inner artist, and talk to your neighbor while having a laugh. Throughout the fall months, they host lots of events that are Halloween-themed like pumpkin pot making and a jack-o-lantern candle holder. Test your knowledge with some trivia around Boston at a different place every day of the week. It’s a nice way to hide away from the impending cold and have a laugh with groups of people over random fun facts.Wine always seems to taste better when it’s a bit chilly out, so stop by local wine shops that are hosting fun social events. Bonde Fine Wine Shop has a weekly Friday Social Club series where four tables are available on a first-come first served basis, so you can enjoy a flight and light bites in an intimate setting. You can bring your own vinyls to add to the ambiance but it must be in line with their weekly theme. Speaking of wine, learn about it in a judgment free zone at free weekly tastings. Local wine shops, like Georgie’s and Urban Grape, host regular classes to meet folks who want to get into the wine scene too.2) Meet others at community reading spacesFall is the perfect time to swaddle up with a book. Grab a tea or a coffee and get ready to chat over your must-reads!Meet some fellow bookworms at local book clubs! In fact, the months of fall usually inspire book clubs to host spooky meetings about thrillers, mysteries, and other haunting novels. Check out your favorite local bookstores who host pop-up book clubs and other events as well. For example, All She Wrote Books has lots of book club events at Juliet Social Club and Park-9. In fact, stop by Side Quest Books and Games, a new woman-owned, fantasy-focused bookstore, that hosts regular monthly book clubs and fun events like “Cozy Hours” where you can vibe with other folks in a small, quiet, heartwarming space. And the local favorite, Trident, hosts fun game nights, free movie showings, and other spooky activities like “Muder Mystery Dinners,” where you can meet new folks as you solve a classic whodunnit.Don’t forget to check out other Spooky Book Events in Boston.3) Cheer on your favorite sports teamsIf you’re looking for something fun and consistent, come cheer on your favorite sports teams at fun bars all over the city. As you sip on a brew, a cocktail, a mocktail, or a soda, and munch on some bar food noms, strike up some easy conversation with the people around you as you make some noise and rep your team.The Anchor hosts weekly Patriots Watch Parties and Notre Dame Watch Parties where you can enjoy waterfront views and some camaraderie. If you’re looking for a different venue to cheer on your favorite teams, join Monday Night Football Watch Parties for free at Primitiv where each evening is capped at 75 guests to ensure an intimate setting to mix and mingle with folks.For even more options for all the football fans, put these 10 Weekly Watch Parties in Boston in your rotation.Check out these spots in Fenway that are great for watching games of all kinds!Some local favorite spots include: ParlorSports, Scores, Phoenix Landing, and Cathedral Station – each with their own weekly updates about what games will be on view!Keep your eyes peeled for more events too as different seasons start throughout the fall months — let’s cheer on our C’s as they go after Banner 19. 4) Attend events for making new friendsLots of local organizations are popping up to host more opportunities for folks to meet new people! Check out these experiences that are coming up in the fall months.Club Volo hosts regular events to connect with others. Join a league while trying a new sport (use ‘JOYRAFT’ for $10 off your first league), head to organized bar outings, and enjoy watch parties too. Don’t forget to stop by one of their free Pickleball Day Parties that happen every Saturday (the last one for this year is on Nov.2). Strawberry Matcha is a new community group that’s hosting meet-ups for people to make friends. Head to their organized outing in Cambridge or at the Public Garden. Don’t forget to fill out their interest form, where they match you every month with a different group of 4-6 folks that they think ~vibe~.The local FB group, How to Make Friends After College, always hosts events that are usually in-theme with the season. Check their listings regularly for new experiences. Some fun ones coming up are a brewery social at Aeronaut Somerville and a foliage walk at Mt. Auburn Cemetery. The Civic Discussion Meetup group adds a twist to meeting people with a common topic already chosen to break the ice. Head to their next event that is promptly named, “How to Make Friends in Boston?,” for a lively chat with strangers about how to build community. Finally, Skip the Small Talk hosts some speed-friending events throughout the year! Head to upcoming experiences at Trident for one where you can meet folks across age groups or a 30s specific event. They bring the prompts, bring yourself and/or a friend!No matter what you choose to explore, just remember to be yourself. A smile and a warm hello can get you far in any of these events, so take a breath and put yourself out there. Happy friend making! Check out Part 1 and Part 2 for other ideas.

Grab a tea or a coffee and get ready to chat over your must-reads! 3) Cheer on your favorite sports teams If you’re looking for something fun and consistent, come cheer on your favorite sports teams at fun bars all over the city. As you sip on a brew, a cocktail, a mocktail, or a soda, and munch on some bar food noms, strike up some easy conversation with the people around you as you make some noise and rep your team. 4) Attend events for making new friends Lots of local organizations are popping up to host more opportunities for folks to meet new people! Check out these experiences that are coming up in the fall months. No matter what you choose to explore, just remember to be yourself. A smile and a warm hello can get you far in any of these events, so take a breath and put yourself out there. Happy friend making! Check out Part 1 and Part 2 for other ideas."

Meanwhile, two “ausländers” from opposite ends of the 20th century present intriguing challenges to traditional assumptions of assimilation and homogeneity in German artistic life. Amidst significant cultural renewal post-World War II, we meet Mauricio Kagel of Argentina and Clara Iannotta of Italy; both are part of a new wave of artists drawn to Germany’s rapidly expanding avant-garde community who make Germany their new home in different ways. Kagel moves to West Germany at the age of 26 and stays on in Köln for the rest of his life, eventually succeeding Stockhausen as director of the Cologne Courses for New Music and making numerous indispensable contributions to the city’s musical life. Still based in Berlin today, Iannotta’s story stands worlds apart from her namesake, constantly crossing boundaries of geography and art as her music pushes the standards of experimentation and exploration. In tandem with Harvard Art Museum’s new Special Exhibition, Made in Germany?, this program takes a look at three composers whose varied careers offer a broader view of German artistic identity and recenters the migrant creatives who continue to redefine and enrich the cultural life of the country and beyond.Trio Gaia, New England Conservatory's most recent graduate piano trio in residence, formed in 2018 and is dedicated to offering audiences dynamic, personally relevant experiences inside and outside the concert hall.

The exhibition and publication center on these lands, and they invite audiences to share histories of knowing, strategies of solidarity, and new horizons for the formation of common ground—on issues of labor, immigration, marginalization, and changes to our climate and natural resources—through creative collaboration. In-person attendees will receive a copy of the publication and the opportunity to visit the exhibition during special viewing hours. For more about the exhibition, visit the exhibition webpage. Extended gallery hours, open from noon to 7 PM. This event is part of ArtsThursdays, a university-wide initiative for free, public art events every Thursday evening. It is supported by the Harvard University Committee on the Arts (HUCA)."

Founded in 2015, the group won the grand prize and gold medal in the senior string division of the 2016 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition and first prize in the 2018 Schoenfeld International String Competition. The quartet’s members hail from Canada, the United States and Taiwan. They have performed in such prestigious halls as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Jordan Hall, the Picasso Museum in Málaga and Washington’s National Gallery of Art among many others. At Juilliard from 2019 to 2022, they were the Lisa Arnhold Fellows, serving as the School’s Graduate Resident String Quartet for 3 years. The group’s name pays homage to Homer’s hero Odysseus and his 10-year voyage home. The members of Ulysses perform on instruments and bows on loan from the Maestro Foundation and private donors. Limited seating is available on a first come, first serve basis. If you require a seat, we encourage you to arrive before the start time of this event. Location: The GBH Studio at the Boston Public Library is located at 700 Boylston St. at the corner of Exeter Street inside the Newsfeed Café."

11 places to see fall foliage in/around Boston,"Saturday, Sep 28, 2024",7:00a,"Saturday, Nov 30, 2024",7:00p,Boston,Boston/Cambridge,FREE,"Date Idea, Photoworthy, Seasonal",https://newengland.com/seasons/fall/foliage/peak-fall-foliage-map,"2024 fall foliage in Boston is expected to peak in mid to late October. Each year, Greater Boston plays host to some of the most vibrant fall foliage colors in the entire world. Besides stepping foot outside your door, or heading to a local park, here are some prime spots around the city to peep fall foliage.2024 fall foliage map for Boston: Head to newengland.com's peak foliage map to see when leaves are predicted to reach peak around Greater Boston.1) Mount Auburn CemeteryWith over 5,000 trees representing 600+ species, Mount Auburn Cemetery is one of the best places to peep fall foliage in the Boston area. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @matthewraifman)2) Boston Public GardenBuilt in 1837, Boston Public Garden was the first botanical garden in the United States. Naturally, the park turns into a foliage wonderland in October. Be sure to check out the adjacent Boston Common for bonus foliage. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @kylekleinphoto)3) Charles River EsplanadeWith a population of 1,700 trees, the Charles River Esplanade turns all sorts of shades of red, orange, and yellow throughout fall. Open in Google Maps.4) Commonwealth AvenueThe Comm Ave Mall (pictured) really steals the show as far as foliage goes in Back Bay. But the colors don’t stop there. You can peep spectacular foliage all throughout the Back Bay and its bordering neighborhood, the South End, in autumn. Look out for magnificent displays of pumpkins and gourds on residential steps in both neighborhoods. In the South End, check out Rutland Square and Southwest Corridor Park for all those foliage feels. Open in Google Maps.

Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @arnold_arboretum)7) Memorial Drive CambridgeMemorial Drive, which runs along the Charles River in Cambridge, becomes quite the fall fairyland every October. Bonus: Every Sunday from the last Sunday of April until the second Sunday of November, Memorial Drive is closed to traffic between Western Avenue and Mount Auburn Street, and open for leaf peeping. Open in Google Maps.8) Acorn Street BostonPerhaps Boston’s most visually iconic street, Acorn Street in Beacon Hill is the epitome of New England fall lined with cobblestones and historic brick homes. In the fall the brilliant autumnal colors make it look even more magical. Do note: the neighbors on Acorn Street can get a little worn out by the tourism so keep a respectful distance when visiting. Open in Google Maps.9) Back Bay FensStroll through the country’s oldest continuously operating Victory Gardens and a series of lawns and greenspace around the Muddy River carefully designed by Frederick Law Olmsted.

(The scene was actually filmed at Johns Hopkins University, but no worries, Harvard is still a fall foliage wonderland in October.) Come experience it for yourself! The bustling campus filled with fall foliage feels especially cozy in the autumn. Open in Google Maps.11) Cedar Grove CemeteryLocated on the banks of the Neponset River in Dorchester, Cedar Grove Cemetery is a beautiful and carefully maintained map of gardens, ponds, and resting places.

Whether you’ve just moved to the city during the fall season or you’re looking for new pals to explore the beauty of Boston as it turns to shades of orange and red, this list has some ideas for how to put yourself out there and grow your community. 🎃By Yelena Nicolle Salvador1) Enjoy cozy activitiesAs the weather turns a bit cooler, you might be feeling the urge to begin to nest inside. No worries, there’s plenty of things to get you to meet folks as you huddle indoors.Check out Pottery With A Purpose, a lovely business that hosts make-your-own pottery mugs, vases, planters, and other containers. Most people come solo to these classes, which are usually small and intimate. It’s a fun way to create, sip on a brew while you channel your inner artist, and talk to your neighbor while having a laugh. Throughout the fall months, they host lots of events that are Halloween-themed like pumpkin pot making and a jack-o-lantern candle holder. Test your knowledge with some trivia around Boston at a different place every day of the week. It’s a nice way to hide away from the impending cold and have a laugh with groups of people over random fun facts.Wine always seems to taste better when it’s a bit chilly out, so stop by local wine shops that are hosting fun social events. Bonde Fine Wine Shop has a weekly Friday Social Club series where four tables are available on a first-come first served basis, so you can enjoy a flight and light bites in an intimate setting. You can bring your own vinyls to add to the ambiance but it must be in line with their weekly theme. Speaking of wine, learn about it in a judgment free zone at free weekly tastings. Local wine shops, like Georgie’s and Urban Grape, host regular classes to meet folks who want to get into the wine scene too.2) Meet others at community reading spacesFall is the perfect time to swaddle up with a book. Grab a tea or a coffee and get ready to chat over your must-reads!Meet some fellow bookworms at local book clubs! In fact, the months of fall usually inspire book clubs to host spooky meetings about thrillers, mysteries, and other haunting novels. Check out your favorite local bookstores who host pop-up book clubs and other events as well. For example, All She Wrote Books has lots of book club events at Juliet Social Club and Park-9. In fact, stop by Side Quest Books and Games, a new woman-owned, fantasy-focused bookstore, that hosts regular monthly book clubs and fun events like “Cozy Hours” where you can vibe with other folks in a small, quiet, heartwarming space. And the local favorite, Trident, hosts fun game nights, free movie showings, and other spooky activities like “Muder Mystery Dinners,” where you can meet new folks as you solve a classic whodunnit.Don’t forget to check out other Spooky Book Events in Boston.3) Cheer on your favorite sports teamsIf you’re looking for something fun and consistent, come cheer on your favorite sports teams at fun bars all over the city. As you sip on a brew, a cocktail, a mocktail, or a soda, and munch on some bar food noms, strike up some easy conversation with the people around you as you make some noise and rep your team.The Anchor hosts weekly Patriots Watch Parties and Notre Dame Watch Parties where you can enjoy waterfront views and some camaraderie. If you’re looking for a different venue to cheer on your favorite teams, join Monday Night Football Watch Parties for free at Primitiv where each evening is capped at 75 guests to ensure an intimate setting to mix and mingle with folks.For even more options for all the football fans, put these 10 Weekly Watch Parties in Boston in your rotation.Check out these spots in Fenway that are great for watching games of all kinds!Some local favorite spots include: ParlorSports, Scores, Phoenix Landing, and Cathedral Station – each with their own weekly updates about what games will be on view!Keep your eyes peeled for more events too as different seasons start throughout the fall months — let’s cheer on our C’s as they go after Banner 19. 4) Attend events for making new friendsLots of local organizations are popping up to host more opportunities for folks to meet new people!

Join a league while trying a new sport (use ‘JOYRAFT’ for $10 off your first league), head to organized bar outings, and enjoy watch parties too. Don’t forget to stop by one of their free Pickleball Day Parties that happen every Saturday (the last one for this year is on Nov.2). Strawberry Matcha is a new community group that’s hosting meet-ups for people to make friends. Head to their organized outing in Cambridge or at the Public Garden. Don’t forget to fill out their interest form, where they match you every month with a different group of 4-6 folks that they think ~vibe~.The local FB group, How to Make Friends After College, always hosts events that are usually in-theme with the season. Check their listings regularly for new experiences. Some fun ones coming up are a brewery social at Aeronaut Somerville and a foliage walk at Mt. Auburn Cemetery. The Civic Discussion Meetup group adds a twist to meeting people with a common topic already chosen to break the ice. Head to their next event that is promptly named, “How to Make Friends in Boston?,” for a lively chat with strangers about how to build community. Finally, Skip the Small Talk hosts some speed-friending events throughout the year!

Meanwhile, two “ausländers” from opposite ends of the 20th century present intriguing challenges to traditional assumptions of assimilation and homogeneity in German artistic life. Amidst significant cultural renewal post-World War II, we meet Mauricio Kagel of Argentina and Clara Iannotta of Italy; both are part of a new wave of artists drawn to Germany’s rapidly expanding avant-garde community who make Germany their new home in different ways. Kagel moves to West Germany at the age of 26 and stays on in Köln for the rest of his life, eventually succeeding Stockhausen as director of the Cologne Courses for New Music and making numerous indispensable contributions to the city’s musical life. Still based in Berlin today, Iannotta’s story stands worlds apart from her namesake, constantly crossing boundaries of geography and art as her music pushes the standards of experimentation and exploration.

Boston’s Best Places to Work Remotely that Aren't a Coffee Shop,"Saturday, Jan 13, 2024",7:00a,"Tuesday, Dec 31, 2024",10:00p,Boston,Surrounding areas,$Varies,"Drinks, Food, Meetup",https://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/boston-s-best-places-to-work-remotely-that-aren-t-a-coffee-shop,"With most people working hybrid or remote roles, third spaces to get work done outside your house have become even more important. And although we love a local coffee shop, small businesses can’t sustain endless laptop traffic. We’ve chosen great remote workspaces that go beyond the typical cafe, offering free WiFi, printing options, bookable conference rooms, or other amenities. Plus, trying out a designed-for-remote work spot allows you to meet other remote workers. Who says you need an office to have a work bestie?  by Celina Colby1) Shy BirdWhere: South Boston & Kendall SquareInfo: Choose from 3 all-day work packages with varying perks from bottomless espresso beverages to free WiFi, free printing, second screens, and more. On the first Friday of each month, you can get free lunch at Shy Bird with a remote work reservation. 2) Capital One CafeWhere: SeaportInfo: Yes, this is technically a cafe, but don’t be fooled by the name, this isn’t your typical coffee stop. You can get coffee and espresso beverages and order off a full food menu, but you can also hook up to free WiFi, utilize plentiful outlets, and even book a nook workspace or small conference room. 3) Venture Café Cambridge: Thursday GatheringWhere: Kendall SquareInfo: Work from the Venture Cafe at the Cambridge Innovation Center on Thursdays and you can attend an after-hours networking event with other creators, entrepreneurs, and visionaries. Each gathering is themed and many feature a guest speaker. 4) The Boston Public Library Kirstein Business Library & Innovation CenterWhere: Back Bay Info: The Boston Public Library is a beloved workplace with tons of seating and outlets, an on-site coffee shop, free WiFI and printing, and WGBH live broadcasting. But the Kirstein Business Library & Innovation Center is an underutilized remote workspace. Book a private conference room or workspace and get access to a 3-D printer, small business coaching, Adobe software, and more, all for free. 5) The Harvard University Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus CenterWhere: Harvard SquareInfo: This meeting ground for the Harvard community (and visitors!) offers a wide array of flexible spaces. Cafe-style tables are great for solo work sessions and coffee intake, and groupings of couches and comfortable chairs are great for team brainstorming sessions or on-site meetings. You may even get a free concert if someone gets to work at the on-site piano. 6) CultureHouse Union SquareWhere: Union SquareInfo: This pop-up community space (test driving for a more permanent community center) offers free co-working space and complimentary coffee and tea. They also have a robust schedule of programs like a LGBTQ soup dinner and a craft group, so it’s a great place to meet like minded people.
