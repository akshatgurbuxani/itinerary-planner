11 places to see fall foliage in/around Boston,"Saturday, Sep 28, 2024",7:00a,"Saturday, Nov 30, 2024",7:00p,Boston,Boston/Cambridge,FREE,"Date Idea, Photoworthy, Seasonal",https://newengland.com/seasons/fall/foliage/peak-fall-foliage-map,"2024 fall foliage in Boston is expected to peak in mid to late October. Each year, Greater Boston plays host to some of the most vibrant fall foliage colors in the entire world. Besides stepping foot outside your door, or heading to a local park, here are some prime spots around the city to peep fall foliage.2024 fall foliage map for Boston: Head to newengland.com's peak foliage map to see when leaves are predicted to reach peak around Greater Boston.1) Mount Auburn CemeteryWith over 5,000 trees representing 600+ species, Mount Auburn Cemetery is one of the best places to peep fall foliage in the Boston area. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @matthewraifman)2) Boston Public GardenBuilt in 1837, Boston Public Garden was the first botanical garden in the United States. Naturally, the park turns into a foliage wonderland in October. Be sure to check out the adjacent Boston Common for bonus foliage. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @kylekleinphoto)3) Charles River EsplanadeWith a population of 1,700 trees, the Charles River Esplanade turns all sorts of shades of red, orange, and yellow throughout fall. Open in Google Maps.4) Commonwealth AvenueThe Comm Ave Mall (pictured) really steals the show as far as foliage goes in Back Bay. But the colors don’t stop there. You can peep spectacular foliage all throughout the Back Bay and its bordering neighborhood, the South End, in autumn. Look out for magnificent displays of pumpkins and gourds on residential steps in both neighborhoods. In the South End, check out Rutland Square and Southwest Corridor Park for all those foliage feels. Open in Google Maps.

Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @jackdarylphotography)6) Arnold ArboretumThe Arboretum's collection of almost 5,000 different species put on a fiery display throughout most of the month of October. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @arnold_arboretum)7) Memorial Drive CambridgeMemorial Drive, which runs along the Charles River in Cambridge, becomes quite the fall fairyland every October. Bonus: Every Sunday from the last Sunday of April until the second Sunday of November, Memorial Drive is closed to traffic between Western Avenue and Mount Auburn Street, and open for leaf peeping. Open in Google Maps.8) Acorn Street BostonPerhaps Boston’s most visually iconic street, Acorn Street in Beacon Hill is the epitome of New England fall lined with cobblestones and historic brick homes. In the fall the brilliant autumnal colors make it look even more magical. Do note: the neighbors on Acorn Street can get a little worn out by the tourism so keep a respectful distance when visiting. Open in Google Maps.9) Back Bay FensStroll through the country’s oldest continuously operating Victory Gardens and a series of lawns and greenspace around the Muddy River carefully designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. You’ll still be in the heart of Boston, but it feels like you’ve left the city for a natural oasis. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by Andrea Monari on Flickr)10) Harvard University’s CampusYou may recall the campus in its autumnal glory in 'The Social Network' when the Zuckerberg character gets dumped then runs across campus back to his dorm to begin coding Facebook for the first time. (The scene was actually filmed at Johns Hopkins University, but no worries, Harvard is still a fall foliage wonderland in October.) Come experience it for yourself! The bustling campus filled with fall foliage feels especially cozy in the autumn. Open in Google Maps.11) Cedar Grove CemeteryLocated on the banks of the Neponset River in Dorchester, Cedar Grove Cemetery is a beautiful and carefully maintained map of gardens, ponds, and resting places. It’s also the spot where you can see the retro Mattapan trolley driving through a foliage-flooded track. Find the bridge nearest Adams Street and you'll see the MBTA trolley tracks running through the Cemetery. Open in Google Maps.

Meanwhile, two “ausländers” from opposite ends of the 20th century present intriguing challenges to traditional assumptions of assimilation and homogeneity in German artistic life. Amidst significant cultural renewal post-World War II, we meet Mauricio Kagel of Argentina and Clara Iannotta of Italy; both are part of a new wave of artists drawn to Germany’s rapidly expanding avant-garde community who make Germany their new home in different ways. Kagel moves to West Germany at the age of 26 and stays on in Köln for the rest of his life, eventually succeeding Stockhausen as director of the Cologne Courses for New Music and making numerous indispensable contributions to the city’s musical life. Still based in Berlin today, Iannotta’s story stands worlds apart from her namesake, constantly crossing boundaries of geography and art as her music pushes the standards of experimentation and exploration. In tandem with Harvard Art Museum’s new Special Exhibition, Made in Germany?, this program takes a look at three composers whose varied careers offer a broader view of German artistic identity and recenters the migrant creatives who continue to redefine and enrich the cultural life of the country and beyond.Trio Gaia, New England Conservatory's most recent graduate piano trio in residence, formed in 2018 and is dedicated to offering audiences dynamic, personally relevant experiences inside and outside the concert hall.

The scenic 3 mile path runs along the Charles River overlooking the Cambridge skyline and, in the summer, the sailboats floating by. Memorial Drive (pictured)Where: CambridgeInfo: There are two wide protected sidewalks on either side of Memorial Drive that are well utilized by both bikers and pedestrians. It’s a shared sidewalk, so be mindful of that, but it makes for a beautiful bike ride overlooking the Charles River and the city skyline. Sections of Memorial Drive are also completely closed to traffic on Sundays. Minuteman BikewayWhere: Cambridge, Arlington, Lexington, BedfordInfo: This bikeway is rich in history, passing through the area where the American Revolution began in 1775.

And although we love a local coffee shop, small businesses can’t sustain endless laptop traffic. We’ve chosen great remote workspaces that go beyond the typical cafe, offering free WiFi, printing options, bookable conference rooms, or other amenities. Plus, trying out a designed-for-remote work spot allows you to meet other remote workers. Who says you need an office to have a work bestie?  by Celina Colby1) Shy BirdWhere: South Boston & Kendall SquareInfo: Choose from 3 all-day work packages with varying perks from bottomless espresso beverages to free WiFi, free printing, second screens, and more. On the first Friday of each month, you can get free lunch at Shy Bird with a remote work reservation. 2) Capital One CafeWhere: SeaportInfo: Yes, this is technically a cafe, but don’t be fooled by the name, this isn’t your typical coffee stop. You can get coffee and espresso beverages and order off a full food menu, but you can also hook up to free WiFi, utilize plentiful outlets, and even book a nook workspace or small conference room. 3) Venture Café Cambridge: Thursday GatheringWhere: Kendall SquareInfo: Work from the Venture Cafe at the Cambridge Innovation Center on Thursdays and you can attend an after-hours networking event with other creators, entrepreneurs, and visionaries.

Smith Campus CenterWhere: Harvard SquareInfo: This meeting ground for the Harvard community (and visitors!) offers a wide array of flexible spaces. Cafe-style tables are great for solo work sessions and coffee intake, and groupings of couches and comfortable chairs are great for team brainstorming sessions or on-site meetings. You may even get a free concert if someone gets to work at the on-site piano. 6) CultureHouse Union SquareWhere: Union SquareInfo: This pop-up community space (test driving for a more permanent community center) offers free co-working space and complimentary coffee and tea. They also have a robust schedule of programs like a LGBTQ soup dinner and a craft group, so it’s a great place to meet like minded people.

We are thrilled to feature exceptional, Boston-based artists, including: We will also screen Mariona Lloreta's ALTARS, a short film that explores the aftermath of police brutality in a young family, followed by a Q&A with the evening's performers and short film cast. A reception with food by Palestinian Chef Abdulla Awad and Mexican-owned Travelmug Cafe, and non-alcoholic drinks by Curious Elixirs will wrap the evening alongside a DJ set by Ashton Lites. Find more information on getting to Hibernian Hall here. We hope you'll join us for an unforgettable evening in community!"

11 places to see fall foliage in/around Boston,"Saturday, Sep 28, 2024",7:00a,"Saturday, Nov 30, 2024",7:00p,Boston,Boston/Cambridge,FREE,"Date Idea, Photoworthy, Seasonal",https://newengland.com/seasons/fall/foliage/peak-fall-foliage-map,"2024 fall foliage in Boston is expected to peak in mid to late October. Each year, Greater Boston plays host to some of the most vibrant fall foliage colors in the entire world. Besides stepping foot outside your door, or heading to a local park, here are some prime spots around the city to peep fall foliage.2024 fall foliage map for Boston: Head to newengland.com's peak foliage map to see when leaves are predicted to reach peak around Greater Boston.1) Mount Auburn CemeteryWith over 5,000 trees representing 600+ species, Mount Auburn Cemetery is one of the best places to peep fall foliage in the Boston area. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @matthewraifman)2) Boston Public GardenBuilt in 1837, Boston Public Garden was the first botanical garden in the United States. Naturally, the park turns into a foliage wonderland in October. Be sure to check out the adjacent Boston Common for bonus foliage. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @kylekleinphoto)3) Charles River EsplanadeWith a population of 1,700 trees, the Charles River Esplanade turns all sorts of shades of red, orange, and yellow throughout fall. Open in Google Maps.4) Commonwealth AvenueThe Comm Ave Mall (pictured) really steals the show as far as foliage goes in Back Bay. But the colors don’t stop there. You can peep spectacular foliage all throughout the Back Bay and its bordering neighborhood, the South End, in autumn. Look out for magnificent displays of pumpkins and gourds on residential steps in both neighborhoods. In the South End, check out Rutland Square and Southwest Corridor Park for all those foliage feels. Open in Google Maps.

Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @jackdarylphotography)6) Arnold ArboretumThe Arboretum's collection of almost 5,000 different species put on a fiery display throughout most of the month of October. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by @arnold_arboretum)7) Memorial Drive CambridgeMemorial Drive, which runs along the Charles River in Cambridge, becomes quite the fall fairyland every October. Bonus: Every Sunday from the last Sunday of April until the second Sunday of November, Memorial Drive is closed to traffic between Western Avenue and Mount Auburn Street, and open for leaf peeping. Open in Google Maps.8) Acorn Street BostonPerhaps Boston’s most visually iconic street, Acorn Street in Beacon Hill is the epitome of New England fall lined with cobblestones and historic brick homes. In the fall the brilliant autumnal colors make it look even more magical. Do note: the neighbors on Acorn Street can get a little worn out by the tourism so keep a respectful distance when visiting. Open in Google Maps.9) Back Bay FensStroll through the country’s oldest continuously operating Victory Gardens and a series of lawns and greenspace around the Muddy River carefully designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. You’ll still be in the heart of Boston, but it feels like you’ve left the city for a natural oasis. Open in Google Maps. (Photo by Andrea Monari on Flickr)10) Harvard University’s CampusYou may recall the campus in its autumnal glory in 'The Social Network' when the Zuckerberg character gets dumped then runs across campus back to his dorm to begin coding Facebook for the first time. (The scene was actually filmed at Johns Hopkins University, but no worries, Harvard is still a fall foliage wonderland in October.) Come experience it for yourself! The bustling campus filled with fall foliage feels especially cozy in the autumn. Open in Google Maps.11) Cedar Grove CemeteryLocated on the banks of the Neponset River in Dorchester, Cedar Grove Cemetery is a beautiful and carefully maintained map of gardens, ponds, and resting places. It’s also the spot where you can see the retro Mattapan trolley driving through a foliage-flooded track. Find the bridge nearest Adams Street and you'll see the MBTA trolley tracks running through the Cemetery. Open in Google Maps.

Meanwhile, two “ausländers” from opposite ends of the 20th century present intriguing challenges to traditional assumptions of assimilation and homogeneity in German artistic life. Amidst significant cultural renewal post-World War II, we meet Mauricio Kagel of Argentina and Clara Iannotta of Italy; both are part of a new wave of artists drawn to Germany’s rapidly expanding avant-garde community who make Germany their new home in different ways. Kagel moves to West Germany at the age of 26 and stays on in Köln for the rest of his life, eventually succeeding Stockhausen as director of the Cologne Courses for New Music and making numerous indispensable contributions to the city’s musical life. Still based in Berlin today, Iannotta’s story stands worlds apart from her namesake, constantly crossing boundaries of geography and art as her music pushes the standards of experimentation and exploration. In tandem with Harvard Art Museum’s new Special Exhibition, Made in Germany?, this program takes a look at three composers whose varied careers offer a broader view of German artistic identity and recenters the migrant creatives who continue to redefine and enrich the cultural life of the country and beyond.Trio Gaia, New England Conservatory's most recent graduate piano trio in residence, formed in 2018 and is dedicated to offering audiences dynamic, personally relevant experiences inside and outside the concert hall.
